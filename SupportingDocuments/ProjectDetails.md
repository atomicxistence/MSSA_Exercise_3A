 # Project History
 >Details of this project can be found on it's [README.md](https://github.com/atomicxistence/MSSA_Exercise_3A/blob/master/README.md)

 I used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/Ipbz85Va/mssaexercise3a) to keep track of my to-do list, issues, fixes for those issues, and time spent developing the project.

 Using a digital task-management tool helped me keep track of my project from wherever I was working. It made updating the individual tasks easy and it allowed me to "attach" fixes for bugs I had to search for.  I was then able to copy-paste these fixes when others ran into the same issues, ie Unicode encoding and IsNullOrWhiteSpace method.

 I did not have an estimated time this project would take me.  I still do not have a good grasp on planning the development progress and estimating how long the planned tasks will take me. However I did *estimate* I would have more time to try to work on an ASP.Net interface. I ended up spending most of my time on the console UI. I then decided to spend my remaining time to further seperate the [GUI code](https://github.com/atomicxistence/ConsoleGUI) for later use.  I ended up taking approximately 21.5 hours on this project.  This number is definitely over the actual time spent, as I did not keep track of breaks and distractions.

 Going forward I would fix an empty list bug that I discovered in my code. Also, I would make an ASP.Net interface that uses my Taskr library.
